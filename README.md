# Coding-Projects-
A collection of my coding projects mainly in C++ and python. 

Homeworks are from my CSE 250 Data structures course. Every Homework had a intended data structure that was to be used. Homework 1 was implemented using Arrays/Vectors. Homework 2 was implemented using stacks queue. Homework 3 was implemented using Maps and sets. Homework 4 was implemented using hastables. Homework 5 was implemented using Tries.

Mail Merge is a side project I did for my school of engineering. Details can be found in the folder with documentation and project description
